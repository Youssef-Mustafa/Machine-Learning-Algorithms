# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

![Machine Learning](https://www.example.com/ml_cover_image.png) <!-- Replace with an actual link to your image -->

## Introduction
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing various machine learning algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm is implemented in Python, and detailed explanations are provided through Jupyter notebooks. 

The goal is to offer a clear and beginner-friendly way to grasp the core ideas behind common machine learning algorithms without relying on external libraries, thus strengthening the understanding of fundamental concepts.

## Installation
To get started with the repository, follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-algorithms-repo.git
   cd ml-algorithms-repo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression
The first algorithm implemented in this repository is **Linear Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. You can find the full implementation in the following files:

- **Source Code:** [`linear_regression.py`](src/linear_regression.py)
- **Jupyter Notebook:** [`linear_regression.ipynb`](notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb)

#### Key Concepts:
- **Gradient Descent:** Used to optimize the weights and bias by minimizing the cost function.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** A loss function used to evaluate the performance of the model.

**Example Visualization:**

### 2. Other Algorithms
More algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Support Vector Machines** will be added as the repository grows.

## Usage
1. **Run Notebooks:**
   Open any Jupyter notebook from the `notebooks` folder to see detailed explanations and interactive code for the respective algorithm.

   To start Jupyter notebooks, use the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Running Python Files:**
   If you'd like to run the source code directly, navigate to the `src` folder and run any Python script:
   ```bash
   python src/linear_regression.py
   ```
